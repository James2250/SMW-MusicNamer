# SMW-MusicNamer

Looks like someone made a professional music identifier, go use that!  (SMW Music Identifier by dtothefourth)

Tries to name custom songs in Super Mario World rom hacks that have inserted music from AddMusicK.  
Just need to run IdentifyMusic.py and give the filename.  

As far as I know there is no easy way to recover the song names without comparing songs against the entire database. 
SMW_Songs.txt is a file database of all custom SMW songs from smwcentral from Sep 30 2021 - July 28 2011

Includes ConvertMusic.py which allows you to have a folder of custom song zips and converts them into the SMW song format.  

Does not support AddMusicM or any older AddMusics.  Does not support songs with sample groups.  
More of a personal project then an official tool.
